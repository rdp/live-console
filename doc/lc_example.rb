This is a demo program for LiveConsole.  It starts a LiveConsole on the
specified port, and you can connect to it by using netcat or telnet to connect
to the specified port.  
	Usage:
		#{$0} [port_number [value_for_$x]]
The default port is 3333, and $x is set by default to nil.  Run this program,
and then in a different terminal, connect to it via netcat or telnet.  You can
check that the value of $x is exactly what you set it to, and that you're
working inside this process, but there's not much to do inside the example
script.  :)
